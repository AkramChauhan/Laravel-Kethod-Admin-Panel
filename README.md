New Feature: Auto Generate CRUD
--
In order to auto generate the CRUD operation. simply run following command.

```
php artisan make:module table_name
```

For example, I want to create a CRUD for the posts table. All you need to do is type

```
php artisan make:module posts //argument is same as your database table name
```

What it will do?
--
It will generate following files
1. Controller  `Http/Controllers/Admin/PostController.php`
2. Model `Models/Post.php`
3. Migration file `/migrations/*.create_posts_table.php`
4. Create Views `/resources/views/theme/posts/*`
```
    1. index.blade.php
    2. ajax.blade.php
    3. manage.blade.php
```
5. It will auto append routes in web.php and menu_arrays.php which will allow you to see new Module in admin panel.

Migration gets auto created with just colomn name. you can modify migration to add additional fields. Well Idea is not to automate everything but saving your time writing scaffolds.

You can create new CRUD manually too. (old fashioned and time consuming).
In order to create new CRUD operation, you can simply copy existing controller file and change {$handle_name} name. It will allow you to create new CRUD operations faster than before.

Structure of Controller File
---
Basic controller file contain following methods. 
1. index 
2. create 
3. edit
4. store
5. update
6. ajax // This screen actually loads data from database and put in index.blade.php 
7. delete

Structure of Blade Files
---
1. table_name/index.blade.php // Base View
2. table_name/ajax.blade.php // For Retriving data
3. table_name/manage.blade.php // For Insert/Edit

e.g. for users table it will be as following.
1. users/index.blade.php
2. users/ajax.blade.php
3. users/manage.blade.php

You can easily clone CRUD operation.
structure of Controller File & Blade files are standard. So you can just copy controller and blade files to create new CRUD operation.

Two Factor Authentication
--
1. This admin panel support TFA by Email.
2. By default two factor authentication is disabled.
3. Once you are logged in. you can go to settings-> edit profile and turn on two factor authentication for you.

*Advance Two Factor Authentication*
If you wanted to advance your two factor authentication. 
1. Modify middleware "twofactor" with your logic.
2. Modify Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController -> authenticated() method with your logic.
3. Two Factor code generation is happening inside User's Model. (Modify if needed)
4. Redirection to Two Factor Screen is happening inside TwoFactorController (Modify if needed)

*Example of new CRUD Operation*
Now, consider that I wanted to create new crud operation for categories. Here are the steps you need to follow.
1. Create model & migration file.
2. Make sure your model uses Softdelete
3. Clone Users/Role Controller and Change handler to 'category'
5. Once you clone controller. make sure your update model name in controller file.
6. Clone directory 'view/themes/your_selected_theme/roles' and name it 'categories' (same as your database table name).
7. Clone roles routes from web.php and change roles to categories & update RoleController to CategoryController.
8. Once you are done with all changes, make sure your blade file (specific ajax.blade file is having fields that you have defined in migration)
